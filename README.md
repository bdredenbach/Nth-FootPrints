# Nth FootPrints

A personal travel journal by Nth Experience. Prototype **0.2.6**.

**[Open Nth FootPrints](https://bdredenbach.github.io/Nth-FootPrints/)**

GitHub Pages serves this repository from `main` / root. The root entry page opens the app in `dist/`; all app resources and the service worker use paths relative to that directory.

Browse your memories in a vertically swipeable photo stack. Tap a photo to open its place details, notes, rating and voice recording.

## Included

- Three tabs: Photo Journal, Map & Directions, and Favorites.
- Create, edit and delete footprints with an original photo, visit date, category, rating, notes, website and phone number.
- Record or attach a voice note.
- Preview and apply embedded photo GPS from supported JPEG, PNG and WebP files; optionally use the photo date.
- Take photo + locate, current-device GPS capture and manual coordinates.
- Individual OpenStreetMap views and external directions.
- Search, category filters and sorting.
- Browser-local IndexedDB storage and app-shell caching.
- Portable app-specific `.nthbackup` export/restore for places, media and preferences. No KMZ.
- Original illustrated starter memories that clear automatically when you save a personal footprint; edited examples are kept.
- Backup & Restore and Preferences above search, with two appearance themes.

## Run locally

The browser application uses static ES modules without third-party runtime dependencies. The APK workflow installs the pinned Capacitor camera/location plugins and bundles their bridge. Serve `dist/` over localhost or HTTPS, for example:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```

Open http://localhost:8000. Camera, microphone, geolocation and installation support depend on the browser and permissions. Data is local to the browser/origin; export a backup before changing devices or clearing browser storage.

## Checks

Node.js 20+:

```sh
npm test
```

Automated checks cover backup round trips, merge behavior, vertical gesture handling including capture changes from photo/caption targets, and geotag parsing. Phone camera/GPS behavior and visual animation still require device testing.

## Project layout

- `dist/`: the application and original assets; no build step required.
- `docs/FEATURE-INVENTORY.md`: reference evidence, implementation notes, limitations and roadmap.
- `docs/BACKUP-FORMAT.md`: the versioned portable backup contract.
- `tests/`: Node tests and small original, generated image fixtures.

The browser prototype and Android debug APK share the same journal UI. Download the latest successful Build Android APK artifact from GitHub Actions. Native widgets, a multi-pin atlas, downloadable offline maps and integrated turn-by-turn navigation remain on the roadmap. Geotags are saved with footprint records; original photo bytes are preserved.

HTC apps and videos were used as behavioral references. No HTC assets, application code, APKs or reference videos are included.

Android builds account for system status/navigation bars and display cutouts, with safe-area spacing around the app and its fixed bottom tabs. The APK workflow builds on changes to app or Android-build files as well as manual runs.

## Android photo capture (0.2.6)

The large photo area chooses an existing gallery image and reads available embedded GPS without substituting your current location. **Take photo + locate** opens the Android camera through Capacitor Camera 8.0.0, attaches the result, then requests a fresh device location through Geolocation 8.0.0. Allow camera and location access when prompted; precise location gives better results. Coordinates are stored in the footprint, not written into image EXIF. A failed location lookup keeps the photo and allows retry/manual entry; cancelling the camera preserves the previous draft.

Install the newly built APK for these native changes; refreshing GitHub Pages cannot update an installed APK. The browser retains its capture-input fallback, whose camera behavior depends on the browser. Android may discard the unsaved editor if it kills the app while the external camera is open; saved journal entries remain intact.
